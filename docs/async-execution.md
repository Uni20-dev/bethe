# Async execution

Bethe uses Uni20's scheduler for independent calculations. It creates no thread
pool of its own and never changes the global scheduler. Existing synchronous
scans wait for the same operation exposed by the Async API.

## State scans

```cpp
#include <bethe/heisenberg_excitations.hpp>
#include <uni20/async/tbb_scheduler.hpp>

uni20::async::TbbScheduler scheduler(4);
bethe::RealExcitationOptions options;
options.count = 10;
options.execution.scheduler = &scheduler;
options.execution.max_in_flight = 8;
auto pending = bethe::heisenberg::real_excitations_async<double>(
    32, uni20::half_int{1}, options);
auto const& result = pending.get_wait(scheduler);
```

The periodic and open XXX APIs provide `real_excitations_async`. Other models
using the shared real-root scanner also use continuous execution through their
existing synchronous APIs. After preparing the ground reference, a bounded
number of runners repeatedly solve candidates. There is no barrier between
successive groups of candidates and no task graph proportional to family size.
The top-K collector retains only the requested levels; ties and the first
failed-state diagnostic use enumeration identity, independent of completion
order. Final energy ordering and numerical convergence rules are unchanged.

`max_in_flight` limits active candidates, not scheduler threads. It defaults to
128. `batch_size` remains for clients that still use batches; both must be
positive. Set BLAS/OpenMP thread limits to one when parallelizing many solves.

## Observable grids

`evaluate_observable_grid_async(count, evaluate, collect, execution)` returns
`uni20::async::Async<std::size_t>` containing the completed point count. A bounded
window retains active and completed-but-uncollected points until ordered
collection releases their slots. The collector runs serially on the scheduler.
The synchronous adapter instead collects on its calling thread; cooperative
waits may execute a kernel there. See [parallel grids](parallel-grids.md).

## Ownership, dependencies and cancellation

Async entry points own their options and decay-copied callables. References
captured inside callbacks remain borrowed. The scheduler and borrowed data must
outlive completion, even if the result handle is discarded. Evaluators must
permit concurrent calls; prepared data should be immutable and scratch local.
No operation changes ambient arithmetic precision.

Pass `pending.read()` to a dependent Uni20 coroutine to consume a result without
a host wait. Errors propagate through the result dependency. Destroying the
handle does not cancel work; use `ExecutionOptions::stop` with a
`std::stop_source`. A stop request prevents further admission and follow-up work
at checkpoints, then waits for active numerical kernels to finish. Kernels are
not interrupted mid-solve.

Scans throw `ScanCancelled` (derived from `ExecutionCancelled`); grids throw
`ExecutionCancelled`. They do not return a partly completed family as success.
Execution errors take precedence over cancellation and propagate only after
owned work has drained. Numerical nonconvergence remains a normal diagnostic
value. A grid may already have emitted an ordered prefix when it fails.

Argument and budget errors are checked before scientific work. A scheduler
admission failure is an execution error, not a failed root or zero spectral
weight. No scheduler-wide drain is used as the completion boundary for an
individual operation.
